# CS 210

Welcome to the CS 210 organization. This repository contains a collection of projects that I have developed as part of the CS 210 course at Southern New Hampshire University. Throughout this class, I focused extensively on mastering C++ and applying it to solve real-world problems.

## About the Course
CS 210 is a foundational course in computer science that emphasizes the principles of programming using C++. The course covers a range of topics, including:
- Introduction to Programming Languages - C++: Getting familiar with the basics of C++ programming language.
- Variables/Assignments - C++: Understanding how to declare variables and assign values to them in C++.
- Branches/Loops - C++: Learning how to control the flow of programs using conditional statements and loops.
- Arrays / Vectors - C++: Managing and manipulating collections of data.
- User-Defined Functions - C++: Creating reusable blocks of code to perform specific tasks.
- Objects and Classes - C++: Delving into object-oriented programming concepts and creating custom classes.
- Files - C++: Working with file input and output operations in C++.
- Exceptions - C++: Handling errors and exceptions gracefully in C++ programs.
- Inheritance/Polymorphism/Abstraction/Encapsulation - C++: Advanced OOP concepts for creating complex and maintainable code.
- Pointers - C++: Mastering memory management and pointer arithmetic in C++.

## What You'll Find Here
In this organization, you'll find the following projects:
- **Project One: Chada Tech Clocks** - A program that displays time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats, allowing users to manipulate time through a user-friendly interface.
- **Project Two: Airgead Banking App** - An application designed to help users understand the growth of investments over time using compound interest.
- **Project Three: Corner Grocer Item Tracker** - A text-based program that analyzes grocery purchase data, helping the store optimize its product layout.

## Why These Projects Matter
Each project was designed to tackle specific challenges that a junior developer might encounter in the real world. They demonstrate my ability to:
- Write clean, efficient, and maintainable C++ code.
- Develop solutions that meet specified functional requirements.
- Apply object-oriented programming principles effectively.
- Work with data files and manage input/output operations.
- Create user-friendly interfaces that enhance the user experience.

## Reflection
These projects helped me solidify my understanding of C++ programming and object-oriented design. They taught me how to effectively manage resources, handle errors, and ensure code quality through best practices. The experience gained from these projects will be invaluable as I continue to advance my programming skills and take on more complex software development challenges.

## Future Applications
The skills I've honed through these projects are highly transferable to other areas of software development. Whether it's working with other programming languages, tackling more complex algorithms, or developing larger-scale applications, the foundation built in CS 210 will serve as a strong base for future endeavors.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope these projects provide a clear representation of my programming skills and the depth of my understanding of C++.
